Student Name: Yousuf Miah
Project Title: Computer Science Project Grading System

Description:
This is a web-based project grading system using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Judges can log in, evaluate group projects, and submit scores.
An admin can log in to view all submissions and see the average grade for each group.
No backend or database is used — all data is stored in localStorage.
